/*
Base Cases:

1. we reached 1 or the number, if we have 1 returned then, go over the stack of functions
example:
5 + (sumnumber( 5 -1))
4 + (sumnumber( 4 -1))
3 + (sumnumber( 3 -1))
2 + (sumnumber( 2 -1))
we reached here the sumNumber (1) so the function returns 1. So it would now go up to

2 + 1 = 3
3 + 3= 6
4 + 6= 10
5 + 10 = 15

return final is 15
