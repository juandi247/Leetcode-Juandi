Question 509 Leetcode

The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, 
such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.


Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.



Example 3:
Input: n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.




Aproach: 

Base cases: 
1. Our first base case would be 1, if we have F(1) the return is 1
2. We neeed to check to for number=0, so we have another base case

Recursion:
Recurse each (number- 1 + number -2) from Number to our base cases.
